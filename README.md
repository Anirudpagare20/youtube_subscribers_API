# YouTube Subscribers Backend API

## Introduction

The YouTube Subscribers Backend is a RESTful API designed to retrieve YouTube subscriber data from a MongoDB database. This project was created to address a specific problem statement, and it follows a modular coding approach for scalability and maintainability.

## Features

- **Modular Codebase:** The project is organized into separate files for different functionalities, enhancing code readability and maintainability.

- **Database Handling:** Database operations are managed in a dedicated file, promoting separation of concerns and easier maintenance.

- **GET Routes:** The API offers three main GET routes to retrieve subscriber data:

  - **GET /subscribers:** Returns an array of subscribers as an object.

  - **GET /subscribers/names:** Returns an array of subscribers with only two fields: name and subscribedChannel.

  - **GET /subscribers/:id:** Returns subscriber details (an object) based on the provided ID. If the ID does not match any subscriber, it responds with a 400 status code and an error message ({message: error.message}).

## Usage

To use this API, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Install the required dependencies using `npm install`.

3. Configure your MongoDB connection by setting the `DATABASE_URI` environment variable in a `.env` file.

4. Start the server using `npm start`.

## Example Requests

### Get All Subscribers

GET http://localhost:3000/subscribers

### Get Subscribers with Names Only

### Get Subscriber by ID
